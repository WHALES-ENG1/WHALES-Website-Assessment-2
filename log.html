                <h2>Week 1</h2>
                <p>As of week one, we met as a group for the first time on Friday. Current tasks assigned include: the
                    creation of
                    the website mock {Joshua}; implementation of the initial website {Aiden}; team branding {Will}; and
                    familiarisation with the product brief to prepare for the first client meeting {everyone}—no tasks
                    running
                    behind at this stage. Website creation is dependent on a website mock-up.</p>

                <p>As of our Monday Meeting this week, all tasks set last Friday have been completed. For the remainder
                    of the
                    meeting, progress has been made on preparing for the client meeting, which is the team's sole task
                    at this
                    stage. Ideas for style and gameplay have been placed in the private Google Drive, and a shared
                    questions
                    document has been created and shared. A shared GitHub organisation has been made.</p>
                <p>As of our Friday meeting, client meeting prep has continued, and the meeting has been set for the
                    following
                    Monday, after the Monday Meeting next week. Continued preparations for client meetings have been
                    made. No other
                    tasks have been set except for ongoing preparation ahead of the client meeting.</p>

                <p>Our Monday Meeting followed on from our previous meeting on Friday. The meeting concluded with the
                    Client
                    Meeting. All members were expected to take notes on requirements gained from the client meeting and
                    bring them
                    to the next meeting on Friday.</p>
                <p>Our Friday meeting started with discussions on role allocation and responsibilities. The decision was
                    made to
                    form teams based on each deliverable, and the size of each team was determined by the marks provided
                    for each
                    deliverable. Roles were recorded on a Google Sheet created by Aiden prior to the meeting. The rest
                    of the
                    meeting involved individual teams discussing what needed to be done. At the end of the meeting, team
                    members
                    were instructed to take the weekend to familiarise themselves with their respective roles and
                    reconvene on
                    Monday, when a timeline for the remainder of the project would be drafted.</p>

                <h2>Week 4</h2>
                <img src="images/devlog/Week4.png" alt="Week 4">
                <p>Our Monday meeting began with an in-depth discussion on the project's remaining timeline, led by the
                    Method
                    Selection and Planning team and the Scrum Leader. Through this discussion, a shared Trello page was
                    created to
                    keep an informal timeline of the project. General themes for weekly tasks have been set for all
                    subsequent weeks
                    up to the project's completion. The latter half of the meeting involved smaller discussions between
                    individual
                    deliverable teams. The requirements teams continued their documentation, as most of the development
                    depends on
                    it. The Architecture, Art, and Implementation teams decided to start on the opening screen as an
                    easier first
                    task to familiarise themselves with the workflows.</p>
                <p>At our Friday meeting, with most of the initial requirements documented, we could begin work on the
                    architecture
                    of the central gameplay portion of the prototype. Most of this meeting’s discussion centred on a
                    high-level game
                    sequence and the architecture of the world object, with the intention of implementing the world
                    object over the
                    weekend. Currently, the only task running behind schedule is the creation of open screen assets, but
                    this has
                    not significantly impacted the project, as we are presently using placeholder assets.</p>

                <img src="images/devlog/Week5.png" alt="Week 5">
                <p>During our Monday discussions regarding assets and the choice to use placeholder assets during
                    development, we
                    have allowed ourselves to push forward with development without the dependency on assets beforehand.
                    This has
                    meant that we have opened the window in which they need to be created and intend to implement them
                    in the later
                    part of the development. Architecture diagrams are also behind; however, the discovery of a
                    functionality in
                    IntelliJ has meant that this task can be done automatically after development. Discussion of
                    architecture is now
                    being held with input from both architecture and implementation teams, given the current pace of
                    development. We
                    have discussed both events and player/entity objects.</p>
                <p>During our Friday meeting, the discussion centred on preparations for work to be done during
                    Consolidation Week.
                    This will mainly consist of final deliverables write-ups, completing the prototype, and then final
                    ‘Beautification’ in week 6 when we reconvene. Due to unforeseen circumstances, some roles have been
                    reassigned
                    to ensure all deliverables are completed on time, with a portion of the responsibility being
                    allocated to team
                    members who have already fulfilled their respective tasks.</p>

                <img src="images/devlog/Week6.png" alt="Week 6">
                <p>During our Monday meeting, we discussed progress made during Consolidation Week. Requirements have
                    been in an
                    almost final state for two to three weeks, so a final write-up is on track. Most Assets are
                    finished, so
                    progress is being made on implementing them. Testing is also on track. The decision to migrate the
                    website to a
                    GitHub URL has been made, and implementing fonts and the Devlog section has been set as a task. The
                    architecture
                    write-up is currently behind schedule, so Joshua has shifted all resources to assist Zach. Risk
                    Assessment Final
                    write-up is on track. The Method Selection & Planning write-up is slightly behind schedule but is on
                    track to be
                    finished by Friday. The Friday meeting is set, as well as a possible meeting on Wednesday or
                    Saturday.</p>
                <p>As of our Friday Meeting, most write-ups are nearing completion or are complete. Risk Assessment and
                    Requirements
                    are complete. All other write-ups are set for completion within the next day. A meeting is scheduled
                    for
                    Saturday to finalise testing and review write-ups.</p>
                <p>As of our Saturday Meeting, all write-ups have been completed and are awaiting final formatting ahead
                    of
                    submission. Testing and minor adjustments have been made to the final gameplay, and development of
                    the mapping
                    tool has been completed to support map creation for future growth. Minor adjustments have been made
                    to specific
                    assets. Submission set for Sunday.</p>
